## The Problem: The "Final Mile" Friction

You asked an AI to write 20 questions. It did a great job. **But now you’re stuck:**

* **The Formatting Nightmare:** Spent 30 minutes fixing "Option A" bullet points in Word?
* **The LMS Wall:** Does your school’s platform (Canvas, Moodle, Kahoot) refuse to "just paste" text?
* **The Math Glitch:** Did your  formulas turn into unreadable gibberish during the copy-paste?

**Generating questions takes seconds. Formatting them takes an hour. That is a broken workflow.**

## The Mission (Why This Exists)

Our goal is **Zero-Effort Integration**. We believe educators and trainers should spend their time **evaluating student progress**, not wrestling with CSV headers and margin alignments.

### ⏳ Time Saved: A Quick Comparison

| Task | Manual Method | With AI Copier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Extracting Q&A** | 10-15 Mins (Copying each line) | **2 Seconds** (Auto-detect) |
| **Formatting Math** | 20 Mins (Fixing symbols) | **Instant** ( Support) |
| **LMS Integration** | 15 Mins (Manual Entry) | **1-Click** (CSV/JSON Export) |
| **Total Prep Time** | **~45-60 Minutes** | **< 1 Minute** |

## Key Value Props

### Instant "Smart-Parse"

Don't worry about how the AI responded. Whether it gave you numbered lists, bold text, or raw blocks, our parser identifies **Question**, **Options**, and **Answer Keys** instantly.

### Multi-Destination Export

One source, infinite possibilities. Export to:

* **Kahoot/Quizizz:** Ready-to-upload Excel templates.
* **Print:** Beautifully formatted PDFs for physical exams.
* **LMS:** JSON/XML for Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle.
* **Dev-Ready:** Markdown for your personal documentation.

### Perfect Math & Code

We treat equations and code blocks as first-class citizens. No more broken `$\sqrt{x}$` or un-indented Python snippets.

## How it Saves Your Day

1. **Paste:** Throw any messy AI output into the hopper.
2. **Verify:** See your questions neatly organized in a clean UI.
3. **Blast:** Export to 3 different formats at once and get back to your coffee.

## The Ultimate Goal

**To reclaim 5 hours of your week.** By removing the technical barrier between AI intelligence and classroom delivery, we empower teachers to create **more frequent, higher-quality assessments** without the burnout.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Extraction

Our AI engine doesn't just "copy" text; it **understands** the structure. It automatically identifies:

* **Question Stems**
* **Multiple Choice Options** (distractors vs. correct answers)
* **Explanation/Rationale**
* **Difficulty Levels & Tags**

### Multi-Format Exporting

Don't be locked into one ecosystem. Move your questions wherever you need them:

* **PDF/Word:** Professional handouts for physical exams.
* **CSV/Excel:** Bulk upload to Kahoot, Quizizz, or Google Forms.
* **JSON:** Seamless integration for developers and custom LMS.
* **Markdown:** Perfect for documentation and GitHub-based learning.

### Math & Code Ready

Whether you are a Chemistry teacher or a Coding bootcamp instructor, we've got you covered. Full support for  equations and syntax-highlighted code snippets.

## How It Works

1. **Generate:** Use your favorite AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to create a set of questions.
2. **Copy:** Paste the raw AI response into the Copier.
3. **Export:** Choose your format and hit **Download**.
